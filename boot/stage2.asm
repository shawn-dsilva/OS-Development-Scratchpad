[ORG 0x0000]      ; This code is intended to be loaded starting at 0x1000:0x0000
                  ; Which is physical address 0x10000. ORG represents the offset
                  ; from the beginning of our segment.

; Our bootloader jumped to 0x1000:0x0000 which sets CS=0x1000 and IP=0x0000
; We need to manually set the DS register so it can properly find our variables
; like 'var'

mov ax, cs
mov ds, ax       ; Copy CS to DS (we can't do it directly so we use AX temporarily)

mov bx, var
mov ah, 0x0e
mov al, [bx]
